We're two Indian couples from Lucknow who love to cook and eat specially eat. We love the Indian food. We love the Creole and Indian Desi Food And we love the Western food that's just part of being in Texas.
Food, you see, isn't only about food. It's not some big secret. It's something that just happens when all of our
interconnected families get
together-the Foddies Heaven and  plus anybody with
enough good sense to marry in.
You may be poor, went the
saying a mere generation ago,
but you'll never be hungry.
Food is part of us because that's
how we were raised; food was
present at births, christenings,
weddings, graduations and
funerals. Food is what reminded us we were family. To this day, whenever one family member meets another and starts talking about something or someplace, the first question has to be, "Kya Khaye gaa bae?" TO MY Nemo, THE GREATEST COOK I EVER KNEW, WHO NOT ONLY TAUGHT ME THE BASICS OF GOOD COOKING, BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING FAMILY GATHER AT THE TABLE, OFTEN.
 In India, we would come to know them all. And talk with them all. And wrestle with them all. And, in some cases, cook with them all. We kept on being who we are, sure enough, but after a while we were something different, too. Something entirely new.
So give us a break here. Don't go picking over our Grandma's and Mamma's and Aunt's and Uncle's recipes, whining about this not being the way they did it at your house. Great! We'll go to your house, this is the way the old folks taught the young folks. This is the way we remember things tasting. And this is what it all comes down to-with generous sprinklings of life, love and oregano-for we Indian couples from India who love to cook and eat really cook sometimes but eat most of the times.
